# Serverless Proxy Example

This is intended as an example for students in the TripleTen Software Engineering BootCamp to use if their frontend final projects require API keys to be hidden. It is not currently deployed anywhere. To test it out yourself, [create your own serverless function](https://www.notion.so/coding-bootcamps/Proxying-requests-to-hide-an-API-key-67c842e40b4c4b12bde4b5e3420ae3b9) based on this code.

For a description of the endpoints, see the comments in `index.js` and `serverless.yml`.
